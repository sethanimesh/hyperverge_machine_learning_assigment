# HyperVerge Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning workflow using PyTorch, focusing on computer vision tasks with images. It leverages the EfficientNet model, data augmentation, and preprocessing techniques. The project is built in Python and structured as a Jupyter notebook.

## Key Components
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - PyTorch: For building and training the neural networks.
  - EfficientNet: A pre-trained model for transfer learning.
  - NumPy, Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - OpenCV: For image processing.
  - Matplotlib: For plotting and visualization.
  - Scikit-learn: For splitting datasets and additional utilities.

## Structure
The notebook follows a step-by-step workflow:
1. **Google Drive Setup**: Mounts Google Drive to access datasets.
2. **Library Imports**: Imports the required Python libraries.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Loads images using OpenCV.
   - Applies transformations using PyTorchâ€™s `transforms` module.
4. **Model Architecture**: 
   - Loads a pre-trained EfficientNet model.
   - Fine-tunes the model for image classification.
5. **Training and Evaluation**: 
   - Trains the model using cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
   - Evaluates the model on a test dataset.
6. **Visualization**: 
   - Displays training accuracy and loss using Matplotlib.
